# Thesis_project
The goal of this project was to create a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. It is coded entirely in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras Libraries. After 25 training epochs the model was able to classify images of dogs and cats with close to 80% accuracy. I'm using the following dataset provided on the TensorFlow repository: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cats_vs_dogs
