# Thesis_project
The end goal of this project is to create a Neural Network that learns a simple task such as solving a Rubix cube or mastering Tic Tac Toe using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
The first phase of this project involves training a simple Artificial Neural Network to predict which customers will leave a banking firm based upon their customer data. This was accomplished with 86% accuracy after 100 training epochs.
The second phase involves creating a Convolutional Neural Net to perform image analysis.
Once I have the proper level of experience with designing these NN class types I will move on to training a third network using reinforcement learning.
